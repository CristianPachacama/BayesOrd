# R package for fitting proportional and non-proportional odds ordinal regression models in a Bayesian framework

This package aims to implement the methods described in McKinley *et al.* (2015), *Bayesian Analysis*, **10 (1)**, P1--30, for fitting ordinal regression models in a Bayesian framework. The methods use reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to perform Bayesian model selection, choosing between proportional odds (PO) and non-proportional odds (NPO) structures, and combinations thereof. The methods are extended to include variable selection based on posterior probabilities of association.
